#### Independent project to practice JS Branching and JQuery with HTML and CSS, 3/27/20

## Description

Script from assignment 

Programming Language Suggester
Create an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Keep in mind that even though all languages have similarities and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still put some thought into which language they should learn.

Then create a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant. Note that you are not required to research the languages extensively and you can even choose silly or irrelevant questions to determine which language would be best - for instance, people that like singing in the rain may prefer Ruby while chihuahua lovers might prefer C#.

Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
Offer a minimum of 3 different language suggestions.
Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.

Note: You are not required to take every possible combination of answers into account. Feel free to use very simple logic, or even ignore the user's responses for some questions as long as you show some good functionality and offer a minimum of 3 languages. It is also not required to publish your project to GitHub pages, but you may do so if you wish.

Objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

All previous standards (last week's objectives) are in place (see below).
Site uses branching to return the result.
jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)
Form gathers input from the user.
Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.
Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
Previous Objectives
For reference, here are last week's objectives:

Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
Project README that includes, bare minimum:
author name
program name
detailed setup instructions
description
copyright and license information
Further Exploration
If you finish the objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features such as:

Ask the user for their name and address them directly in all of the responses to them: "Enrique, you ought to study Java, so you can learn how to make mobile apps for Android!".
Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c) and determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected. For example: "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!".
Use fade in/out or slide in/out jQuery Effects throughout your project.
Other enhancements such as more custom CSS, animation, or modals as you desire.
Submission
Submit your code for review to the JavaScript and jQuery code review on Epicenter by 5pm on Friday.

Visit the Independent Projects and Code Reviews page for details on how to submit your code, how feedback works and course completion requirements.
